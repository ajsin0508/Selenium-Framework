#AS Tesco Bank
#I WANT to create pdf versions of the required loan documentation
#SO THAT I can provide the customer with details of the agreement in a durable format
#===

#Scenario 1: Generate understanding your loan pdf
#GIVEN the customer is eligible to sign their application digitally
#OR the customer will be sent a paper form for signature
#WHEN all of the necessary information has been collected from the customer
#THEN the Understanding your loan pdf is generated 
#AND the pdf includes the parameterised values noted below
	#Total amount of credit: loan amount selected by customer on loan offer calculator £.pp (assume from £100.00 to £99,999.99)
	#Total amount to pay: calculated amount from loan offer calculator £.pp (assume from £100.00 to £99,999.99)
	#Repayments: monthly repayment amount from loan offer calculator £.pp (assume from £0.99 to £9,999.99)
	#APR: APR from loan offer calculator to at least one decimal place, more if used (assume from 0.1% to 999.9999% and from 1 to 4 decimal places)
	#Rate of interest: fixed rate from loan offer calculator to 4 decimal places (assume from 0.0001% to 999.9999%)
